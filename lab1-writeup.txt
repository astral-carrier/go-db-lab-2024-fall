There were no API changes for this assignment.

I did not finish the section for heap files due to time constraints. The buffer pool and heap page code is also untested
as a result, since the tests for both requires the completion of heap files.

I estimate that I spent about 12 hours on this lab. I struggled a lot before Steven helped us out by showing us pseudocode.
Another major difficulty was that the tests for one component often require another component to be implemented in order
to run.
